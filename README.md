## Data Cleaning and Processes.

In Power BI, data cleaning is performed using the Power Query Editor, a powerful tool that helps to shape and manipulate data before it gets loaded into the Power BI data model. Data cleaning helps to achieve high data integrity, data quality, maintain data consistency, and accuracy. 

Based on the insight generated from data profiling, dataset for this analysis is well-structured, consistent, and free from significant issues that could hinder analysis or interpretation. The data follows a standardized format and adheres to consistent naming conventions. All necessary data fields are present and populated, the data values are accurate, data types are appropriately assigned to each column, and has no duplicate records. Therefore, no further cleaning is required.

The following process was carried out during data processes.

- Added a new table

Northwind Traders Food Supplier runs a fiscal year that starts on July 2013 and end 12 months later. Therefore, adding a calendar table is important in this analysis. A calendar table is a table with unique date value, often referred to as a date dimension or time table. 
![](Calendar_Table.png)

This table was marked as date table. Marking a calendar table as a date table in Power BI enhance time-based calculations, navigation, and interactions within Power BI reports. When a calendar table is marked as date table, it’s like telling Power BI that the table contains date-related information, allowing the system to optimize certain functionalities such as Time Intelligence Functions. Marking a calendar table enables the use of time intelligence functions in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). Functions like TOTALYTD, TOTALQTD, TOTALMTD, and others work more effectively when applied to a designated date table. These functions help with year-to-date, quarter-to-date, and month-to-date calculations.

Calendar table contain nine columns which are Date, Month Name, Month Number, Quarter, Year, Fiscal Month Number, Fiscal Month Name, Fiscal Year, and Fiscal Quarter. Incorporating a calendar table into Power BI model helps to create a custom fiscal calendar, aligning with the organization's financial reporting periods. It helps to perform time intelligence functions that work seamlessly with a well-structured calendar table. These functions also help to perform various time-based calculations, such as year-to-date and month-to-month comparisons. A calendar table also help to create a date hierarchy, providing a natural and intuitive way to drill down into data. Users can easily navigate from year to month, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Data Modelling

Data modeling in Power BI involves structuring and organizing data to create meaningful relationships between different tables. A well-designed data model is essential for building accurate and insightful reports
![](Data_Model.png)

Established an active and inactive relationships between tables using common fields (keys), examined the relationships diagram to ensure that relationships between tables are correctly defined and accurately represents the connections between tables. An active relationship is the default relationship between tables that Power BI uses for filtering and calculations. When relationship is being created between two tables, Power BI assumes it's an active relationship unless it has been specified otherwise. Active relationships are used for most calculations and visualizations. An inactive relationship is an additional relationship between tables that is not used by default for filtering or calculations. Inactive relationships helped to have multiple relationships between tables without causing conflicts. Inactive relationships are useful to create more complex models, such as scenarios involving different date relationships. It helps to analysis data base on different perspectives. In this analysis, established Inactive relationship between Calendar table (Date Column) and Order table (Shipped Date Column). This helped to use different date relationships in different contexts. When creating measures or calculations, USERELATIONSHIP function was used to explicitly reference the inactive relationship. 

Reviewed cardinality (e.g., one-to-many) and cross-filtering settings for each relationship. Cardinality defined the nature of relationship that exist between tables, it explains how one table relates to the other. This helped to ensure accurate and meaningful results in reports. Cross-filtering direction refers to the direction in which filter flows between two related tables. Properly set cross-filter direction for creating effective relationships data model and ensured that reports accurately reflect the intended relationships between tables.

## Data Analysis and Insight

The objective of this analysis is to understand sales trends, identify best and worst selling products, recognize key customers, and assess shipping cost consistency by analyzing the sales and order data of Northwind Traders. 

**NOTE:** In the course of this analysis, encompassing fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the current set of results reflects the specific outcomes derived when the slicer was configured to the fiscal year 2015, providing a focused view on the corresponding data and insights within that particular timeframe.

**This analysis provides answers to the following questions.**

**1. Are there noticeable sales trend in overtime?**

This refers to the examination of sales and order data to identify patterns, tendencies, or recurring behaviors in the context of time. It involves analyzing how sales performance changes and evolves over a specific period. To identify noticeable sales trends over time, typically performed time series analysis on the sales and order data. This type of analysis is valuable for understanding patterns, trends, and behaviors within the data over time.

In Power BI, a comprehensive approach was taken to identify significant sales trends over time by creating a measure that calculates the total revenue. 

_DAX code for calculating Total Revenue_

```Total Revenue = SUMX (Tbl_Order_Details, Tbl_Order_Details[Quantity]* Tbl_Order_Details[UnitPrice])```

This measure was then utilized in conjunction with visualization tool, line chart.

Line chart graphically represent and analyze the evolving patterns and fluctuations in sales data, thereby providing a clearer and more insightful understanding of the temporal dynamics within the dataset.
![](Revenue_Trends.png)

- From this analysis, there is a general increasing trend in revenue from July to March, indicating a positive sales trajectory and strong performance during this period. This trend suggests successful sales strategies, customer engagement, or market demand during these months.
- May stands out with a significant drop in revenue. There may be external factors affecting sales in May, such as seasonal changes, economic conditions, or specific market events. 
- June reports zero revenue, indicating a potential issue or anomaly. Operational challenges, data entry error or system issues may be contributing to the absence of sales data in June.

After the initial analysis, I dug deeper to figure out which months had higher or lower revenue compared to the previous month. This detailed exploration helped to understand the patterns in revenue changes over time. The results of this analysis are neatly shown in a waterfall chart, making it easy to see and grasp the factors influencing revenue fluctuations from month to month.

Waterfall chart graphically represent and analyze sales data to show percentage increase in revenue compared to the previous month. A waterfall chart is beneficial for visualizing the month-to-month changes in revenue in a sequential manner. Each column in the waterfall chart represents a month, and the vertical movement between columns represents the percentage change in revenue. The chart effectively highlights positive and negative contributions to revenue changes. Positive values would be represented by columns going upwards, while negative values would be represented by columns going downwards. 

A comprehensive approach was taken to create a measure that calculate percentage increase in revenue compared to the previous month.

1. _DAX code for calculating Total Revenue_

```Total Revenue = SUMX (Tbl_Order_Details, Tbl_Order_Details[Quantity]* Tbl_Order_Details[UnitPrice])```

2. _DAX code for calculating Previous Month Revenue_

```Previous Month Revenue = CALCULATE ([Total Revenue], PREVIOUSMONTH('Calendar'[Date]))```

3. _DAX code for calculating % Increase in Revenue Compared to Previous Month_

```%MOM Revenue = DIVIDE ([Total Revenue] - [Previous Month Revenue], [Previous Month Revenue],0)```

%MOM measure was then utilized in conjunction with visualization tool, waterfall chart.
![](MOM_Trends.png)

- From this analysis, July, September, October, December, January, February, March, and April exhibit positive revenue growth compared to the previous month with December and April leading in percentage increases.
- August, November, May, and June show a decline in revenue compared to the previous month.

**2. Which are the best and worst selling products?**

Analyzing the sales and order data for Northwind Traders, it's essential to identify best and worst selling products based on a certain criterial. In this analysis, best and worst selling products are recognized base on there contribution to the revenue generated. 

To identify the best and worst selling products in Power BI, a measure that calculate the revenue made on each product was created and then used bar chart to display the results. 

A comprehensive approach was taken to create a measure that calculate total Revenue

_DAX code for calculating Total Revenue_

```Total Revenue = SUMX (Tbl_Order_Details, Tbl_Order_Details[Quantity]* Tbl_Order_Details[UnitPrice])```

This measure was then utilized in conjunction with visualization tool, bar chart then filtered in the filter pane to only display top 5 best selling product and worst 5 selling product by revenue.

**Best Selling Product**
![](Top_5_Product.png)

- From this analysis, Côte de Blaye stands out as the top revenue generator despite a lower unit sales volume (305 units). This product commands a high price, contributing significantly to revenue. The lower unit sales suggest a higher value perception among customers.
- Thüringer Rostbratwurst follows closely in revenue, with a higher unit sales volume (514 units). This product combines strong sales volume with a competitive price, indicating a popular and reasonably priced item among customers.
- Raclette Courdavault ranks third in revenue with a substantial unit sales volume (879 units). This product achieves a balance between volume and price, indicating a solid market presence and customer appeal.
- Camembert Pierrot is the fourth-highest revenue generator with a commendable unit sales volume (922 units). This product's revenue is driven by both unit sales and pricing, reflecting its popularity among customers.
- Tarte au sucre secures the fifth-highest revenue, with a moderate unit sales volume (625 units). This product contributes to revenue with a balanced combination of unit sales and pricing. 

Understanding the interplay between unit sales and revenue for each product allows Northwind Traders to tailor strategies for optimal performance and sustained growth in the gourmet food market.

**Worst Selling Product**

![](Bottom_5_Product.png)

- From this analysis, Genen Shouyu has revenue of $1163 with 75 units sold. This product may have limited market appeal or faces challenges in commanding higher prices. 
- Longlife Tofu follows with revenue of $950 and 95 units sold. While unit sales are slightly higher than Genen Shouyu, the revenue remains low. Consider exploring opportunities to enhance the product's perceived value, such as through marketing campaigns emphasizing its unique qualities or versatility.
 - Louisiana Hot Spiced Okra generated revenue of $935 with 55 units sold. The relatively low revenue and unit sales may suggest a niche market or limited demand. Assessing the market segment and potential adjustments to product positioning or marketing efforts could be considered.
- Geitost has revenue of $760 with 304 units sold. Despite a higher unit sales volume, the revenue remains lower. Evaluate the pricing strategy and explore options to increase the perceived value of Geitost, potentially through promotions or product bundling.
- Chocolade is among the bottom products with revenue of $485 and 38 units sold. The low revenue and unit sales may indicate challenges in positioning or marketing.

**3. Can you identify any key customers?**

key customers are customer who significantly contribute to the success and growth of the business. Analyzing the sales and order data for Northwind Traders, it's essential to identify key customers based on a certain criterial. In this analysis, key customers are recognized base on there contribution to the revenue generated. 

To identify key customers by revenue generated in Power BI, a measure that calculate the total revenue made on each customer was created and then used bar chart to display the results. 

A comprehensive approach was taken to create a measure that calculate total Revenue

_DAX code for calculating Total Revenue_

```Total Revenue = SUMX (Tbl_Order_Details, Tbl_Order_Details[Quantity]* Tbl_Order_Details[UnitPrice])```

This measure was then utilized in conjunction with visualization tool, bar chart then filtered in the filter pane to only display top 5 customers by revenue.

![](Top_5_Customer.png)

- From this analysis, Save-A-Lot Markets emerges as the top key customer, generating $87,174 in revenue. Save-A-Lot Markets' substantial contribution to revenue indicates a strong and consistent business relationship.
- Ernst Handel follows closely, contributing $75,488 in revenue. Ernst Handel's significant revenue suggests a robust partnership. 
- Quick-Stop ranks third among key customers, with revenue totaling $72,041. Quick-Stop's substantial contribution positions them as a valuable customer.
- Hungry Owl All-Night Grocers contributes $37,235 in revenue. While not as high as the top customers, Hungry Owl All-Night Grocers remains a key contributor. 
- Hanari Carnes rounds out the top five key customers with $28,681 in revenue. Despite a lower revenue contribution, Hanari Carnes remains significant.

Understanding and prioritizing key customers enables Northwind Traders to strategically cultivate relationships, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable revenue growth

**4. Are shipping costs consistent across providers?**

Analyzing the shipping costs across different providers is crucial to assess consistency and identify potential areas for optimization

To identify if shipping cost are consistent in Power BI, a measure that calculate the total freight (The shipping cost for the order (USD)) for each provider was created and then used visualizations such as column chart to display the results. 

A comprehensive approach was taken to create a measure that calculate total freight.

_DAX code for calculating Total freight_

```Total Shipping Cost = CALCULATE(SUM(Tbl_Order[Freight]), USERELATIONSHIP(Tbl_Order[Shipped Date], 'Calendar'[Date]),Tbl_Order[Shipped Date]<> BLANK())```

USERELATIONSHIP function in this measure was used to switch an inactive relationship between the calendar table's date column and the Order table’s shipped date column to become active, and simultaneously convert the original active relationship to inactive. This change occurs within the scope of the specific measure, while the original relationship settings in the Power BI data model remain unchanged.

The "Shipped Date" column in the Order table has some entries with null values. These null values represent orders that were placed but not yet shipped. As a result, these entries are intended to be excluded or filtered out from the analysis. Therefore, ```“Tbl_Order[Shipped Date]<> BLANK()”``` was use within this measure to filter the null values out from the analysis.

This measure was then utilized in conjunction with visualization tool, column chart to display total shipping cost for each provider.
![](Shipping_By_Provider.png)

- From the analysis, United Package incurs the highest total shipping cost among the three providers. The higher cost may be attributed to various factors such as service levels, shipping distances, or additional services offered.
- Federal Shipping has a moderate total shipping cost compared to the other providers. The cost falls in the middle range, suggesting a competitive position. 
- Speedy Express has the lowest total shipping cost among the three providers. While offering cost advantages, it's essential to ensure that the lower cost doesn't compromise service quality or delivery speed.

From this analysis, there is a clear variation in shipping costs across providers, with United Package incurring the highest cost, followed by Federal Shipping and Speedy Express. The inconsistency in shipping costs suggests that each provider may have different pricing structures, service levels, or operational efficiencies affecting their charges.

After the initial analysis, I took a closer look at how shipping costs change over time. This detailed exploration helped me understand the performance trends in shipping costs among different providers. It's like looking at a timeline to see patterns and changes in shipping expenses. This kind of analysis is valuable for spotting trends and behaviors in the data over a specific period.
![](Shippin_Trends.png)

- From this analysis, Federal Shipping shows variations, with higher costs in peak months like August, October and April. Understanding these seasonal trends can help in planning and optimizing logistics.
- Speedy Express consistently demonstrates competitive shipping costs, making it a cost-efficient option for several months.
- United Package shows varying costs, with significant spikes in months like February and April and its impact on overall shipping expenses should be carefully assessed. Consider negotiating terms or exploring alternative providers for potential cost savings.

## Recommendation

**1.	Sales Trends**

- May's revenue drop and zero revenue in June present opportunities for improvement. Targeted marketing campaigns, promotions, or operational enhancements may be explored to address and rectify these issues.
- Design targeted marketing campaigns or promotions to sustain positive growth during peak months and use data-driven insights to tailor strategies based on customer behavior and preferences.
- Identify and leverage successful strategies implemented during high-growth months (e.g., December and April). Incorporate these strategies into marketing, promotions, and inventory management for other periods.
- Foster collaboration between marketing, sales, operations, and finance teams. Cross-functional communication ensures alignment in strategies and a unified approach to revenue optimization

**2. Best and Worst Selling Product** 

Best Selling Product
- Organize promotional events or tasting sessions featuring these top-selling products. Events can create buzz, attract new customers, and provide opportunities for direct engagement.
- Introduce a customer loyalty program that rewards frequent purchasers of these top-revenue products. Loyalty programs can enhance customer retention and foster a sense of appreciation.
- Invest in employee training to ensure staff members are well-informed about product features, benefits, and recommendations. Knowledgeable staff can enhance the customer shopping experience.
- Engage with customers who purchase Camembert Pierrot to understand their preferences. Use this insight to tailor marketing strategies, and consider introducing new variations or packaging to keep the product fresh and appealing.

**Worst Selling Products**

- Review the positioning of these bottom products in the market. Consider adjustments to product positioning, messaging, or packaging to better align with customer expectations and market trends.
- Explore collaborative marketing efforts with other products. Partnering with complementary items in promotions or marketing campaigns can create synergies and attract a broader audience.
- Actively seek and integrate customer feedback for these bottom products. Understanding customer preferences and addressing any concerns can guide product improvements and marketing strategies.
- Consider cross-promotions that feature these bottom-selling products alongside more popular items. Bundles or package deals can encourage customers to explore a variety of products, potentially boosting sales.

**3. Identify key customers**
- Adopt a long-term relationship focus with key customers. Invest in strategies that contribute to sustained loyalty, repeat business, and positive word-of-mouth.
- Schedule regular business reviews with key customers to discuss performance, identify challenges, and explore collaborative solutions. This proactive approach strengthens partnerships and ensures alignment with customer expectations.
- Conduct customer satisfaction surveys with key customers. Gather feedback on their experience, preferences, and areas for improvement to enhance overall satisfaction

**4. Shipping costs consistency across providers**

- Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the value derived from each provider's shipping services. Consider factors such as delivery speed, reliability, and overall customer satisfaction.
- Evaluate the service levels provided by each shipping provider. Higher costs from United Package might be justified if they offer premium services that align with business needs.
- Explore negotiation opportunities with providers, especially if there is a significant shipping volume. Negotiating better terms can lead to cost savings without compromising service quality.
- Assess how the shipping costs impact customer expectations. Ensure that the chosen provider aligns with customer preferences and doesn't negatively affect the overall customer experience.
